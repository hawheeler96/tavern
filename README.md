## Disclaimers

Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a game published by Wizards of the Coast, a subsidiary of Hasbro. I do not claim ownership of the system or its content.

## Current Features & Usage

1. Sign up or sign in: Access only your own created content by signing in or signing up with our secure user authentication. 

2. Create new characters: Create new characters with ease via our character creator. Currently limited to some basic character background information and stats, we have plans to expand this creator into a robust and highly customizable experience.

3. View your characters: Whether from the home page or the "All Characters" tab, you can view your characters' adventurer's licenses (character sheets) with ease. 

4. Edit or delete characters: Made a mistake? Leveling up? Just feeling done with a character? With our easy edit and delete fields, you can curate your characters as you see fit. 

## Future Features

1. Custom content: Add custom content such as spells, classes, subclasses, feats, etc. with ease. 

2. Enhanced character customization: Our enhanced character customizer will allow users to add all the information they need to play, as well as some cosmetic changes like themes and avatars. 

3. Robust character sheet: View all information you need to know to play your games, including class/racial features, attacks, spells, etc.

4. Content filtering and turn tracking: Are you tired of searching through your character sheet to find what options you have for a bonus action or reaction? Have you ever forgotten you had a bonus action available and missed out on a move that could have saved your party? We certainly have. That's why we intend to make your character information filterable by action, reaction, and bonus action, as well as by offensive, defensive, and support abilities. This filtering will be paired with our turn tracker that will pull up and categorize all of your options underneath their action time, allowing you to check them off as you complete your action, bonus action, or reaction before resetting the tracker for your next turn. 

5. One-stop-shop: Do you have a 10-page backstory, a pinterest board, a character playlist, and more character art than you know what to do with? Why not store them all in the same place? Alongside your character sheet will be tabs for all of your character's inspiration and information for ease of access.

## Contributions

I apologize, but Tavern is not accepting contributions at this time. While this may change in the future, at the moment I am using this as a very personal project to grow my full-stack skills using a subject I care deeply about. I will be sure to update the repo if this changes!
